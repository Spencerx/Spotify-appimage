This AppImage has been built from the official deb package.

If you would like to see an official Spotify AppImage, vote on [community.spotify.com](https://community.spotify.com) and let [SpotifyCares](https://twitter.com/SpotifyCares) know. [A first attempt went and died ](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Provide-Spotify-Desktop-Client-in-cross-distro-AppImage-bundle/idi-p/1337399), but now you can do the difference.

I'm not allowed to distribute Spotify AppImage as an official release, so take this release as an experimental version.
