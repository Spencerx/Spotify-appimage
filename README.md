# Spotify-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage for Spotify. This is only an experimental release for test (download [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Spotify-AppImage/releases)), created from a popular repository in AUR: use it at your own risk!

If you would like to see an official Spotify AppImage, vote on [community.spotify.com](https://community.spotify.com) and let [SpotifyCares](https://twitter.com/SpotifyCares) know. [A first attempt went and died ](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Provide-Spotify-Desktop-Client-in-cross-distro-AppImage-bundle/idi-p/1337399), but now you can do the difference.

I'm not allowed to distribute Spotify AppImage as an official release, so take this release as an experimental version.

If you're looking for furter releases, use [AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan), a command line utility that downloads and creates AppImages taking packages from known sources.

# How to use [AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan)

INSTALL and/or UPDATE using this command:

`appman -i spotify`

In this way will be downloaded, unpacked and repacked a package from Arch User Repository converting it to an AppImage. Use this command each time a new official release for GNU/Linux is ready.
